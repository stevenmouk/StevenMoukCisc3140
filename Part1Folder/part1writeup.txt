It was difficult to create the same program in bash. I am very used to java and know how to use all
of the syntax very well. However, bash was much more difficult without know all of the syntax or how to 
use date addition and subtraction. I was able to get the script to print the days until the assignments, quizes, and finals.
I was not able to add the additional features. I mostly struggled with compiling errors due to using a mac version of bash. 
There is no "date -d" function on the posix bash which caused a lot of trouble when trying to solve the issue with date subtraction. 
That difference between posix bash and regualar bash made it difficult to have all of the features. 

Much of the commands were pretty similar. The arrays were mostly the same, so were the if statements and for loops. The 
difference was there was no types, similar to javascript. Also the syntax was very different from what I was used to in java.
Finally, java doesn't have different types like bash has with posix. 

I strongly prefer java. I was able to write very clean code that got rid of almost all repeating code. The date object was very easy to use
once I took a look at the java docs. Bash was much more difficult, it took only two lines of code to print and read a date but I did not enjoy using it.
There are no defined types which makes working with dates difficult. The java code is much better written in my opinion. 

For bash I didn't use any libraries. For the java file, I used localDate and Period imports to get the date objects and 
be able to find the difference between dates. For java, it would have been very difficult to re-create all of the functionality of the 
date object without importing.
